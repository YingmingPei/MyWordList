# MyWordList

**MyWordList** is an open-source vocabulary training tool designed for students preparing for **TOEFL writing** and **GRE vocabulary**.
It allows you to create and customize your own wordlists, practice translations in both directions (EN→CN and CN→EN), and strengthen memory with spaced repetition of mistakes.

**✨ Key Features**

- 📖 **Custom wordlists**: import your own Excel files with bilingual vocabulary.

- 🔄 **Two practice modes**:

  - Chinese → English (TOEFL writing collocations, idiomatic expressions)

  - English → Chinese (GRE vocabulary recall)

- 🎯 **Spaced review**: mistaken words are repeated until mastered.

- 🔢 **Progress tracking**: mistake frequency is recorded to guide review.

- 🔀 **Flexible order**: choose alphabetical practice or random shuffle.

- 📂 **Multi-sheet support**: handle multiple wordlists in a single Excel file.

- 📝 **Session control**: practice in chunks (e.g., 50 words) with save-and-exit options.

This project is mainly developed for **PhD application preparation**, but it can be used by anyone who wants to master vocabulary efficiently.
